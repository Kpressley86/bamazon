# **BAMAZON** [Portfolio!](https://kpressley86.github.io/Portfolio/)

Bamazon is an app I created using mySQL and Node.js. I used mySQL to create a local database with 2 tables and Node.js to add to and update my database.

## Bamazon Customer 

* On startup it will ask if you want to purchase something then list the available items. After selecting an item from the list it will ask you how many you would like to purchase.  After completing purchase it will display the cost and you can exit or continue shopping.

* Notice the Quantity of item changes after purchase!

## Bamazon Manager

* On startup gives you a list of Manager tasks to preform.

*Low inventory will display all items under 10 then prompt you to choose another task... like add to inventory!

* After selecting add to inventory it will ask how many you want to order. After placing the order notice current inventory is updated and its no longer in the low inventory table.
